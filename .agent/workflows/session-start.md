1. Read the project overview file to get full context before doing anything else:
   - Read `d:\AntiGravitySoftware\GitWorkspace\MqlTradeMonitor\PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`
   
   This file contains:
   - How to build/start the server (Eclipse only, no mvn in PATH, no mvnw)
   - Full project structure with descriptions of all important files
   - All API and dashboard endpoints
   - Database schema (all tables)
   - Frontend conventions
   - Common errors and solutions
